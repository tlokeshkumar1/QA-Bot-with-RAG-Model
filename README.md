# 📚 RAG Model for QA Bot 🤖  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model** for a **QA (Question-Answering) Bot**. The bot efficiently retrieves relevant document information and generates responses using a **Large Language Model (LLM)**. It leverages **Pinecone** for vector storage and fast document retrieval.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **RAG Architecture** – Enhances response accuracy by retrieving relevant context before generating answers.  
✅ **Pinecone Vector DB** – Stores and retrieves document embeddings for efficient search.  
✅ **LLM-Based Answer Generation** – Uses a language model to generate context-aware responses.  
✅ **Scalability & Performance** – Designed for real-time applications like customer support, knowledge management, and research assistants.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face models)**  
- **Pinecone (Vector Database)**  
- **FastAPI / Flask (for API deployment, if needed)**  
- **Faiss / LangChain (for additional retrieval options, if applicable)**  

## 📌 Setup & Installation  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/tlokeshkumar1/QA-Bot-with-RAG-Model/
cd rag-qa-bot  
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

### 3️⃣ Configure API Keys  
- Set up API keys for **Pinecone** and your **LLM provider** (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere).  
- Create a `.env` file and add:  
```ini  
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key  
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_key  
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Application  
```bash  
python main.py  
```

### 5️⃣ Test the QA Bot  
Use the API endpoint or command-line interface to ask questions and get relevant answers!  

## 🎯 Example Usage  
```python  
query = "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?"  
response = qa_bot.get_answer(query)  
print(response)  
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Improve ranking and filtering for better retrieval.  
🔹 Experiment with different embedding models.  
🔹 Deploy as a web-based chatbot.
